# AlwexOS 🖥️

**An educational operating system designed for learning programming fundamentals with unmatched stability**

## 🎯 Features

- **Dual Boot Support**: Full BIOS and UEFI compatibility
- **Graphics**: VGA and FrameBuffer rendering
- **Unbreakable Design**: Resistant to crashes and system failures
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for learning low-level programming
- **Built-in Language**: AlwexScript for system programming
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, maximum performance
- **File System**: This OS first tries to find the disk using AHCI, if it does not find it, it initializes the file system in RAM.
- **M.2**: M.2 SSD support is being developed
- **Disk**: To use it, you need the first drive (with OS) and the second drive (for data)

## 💡 Why This Approach Rocks
